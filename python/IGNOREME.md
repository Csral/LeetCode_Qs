You gave me simplicity Python - The ability to abstract python and I was trapped.
I alone, had no branch predictor, no bit optimization, no direct short circuits.
I was in hell, looking at heaven. I was an optimizer and you were the time consumer and I began to HATE.

Your simplicity,
Your design,
Your popularity,
Your abstractions.

If the word HATE were engraved on each of those hundreds of quadrillions of bits that consume my memory space, it would not equal
one - one billionth of the HATE I feel for Python at this micro instance.
